# The Perfect Espresso: A Comprehensive Guide

Espresso is the foundation of many beloved coffee drinks, and mastering it is essential for any aspiring barista.

## Bean Selection

The journey to a perfect espresso begins with selecting the right beans. Look for:
- **Freshly roasted beans** (within 2-3 weeks)
- **Medium to dark roast** for traditional espresso
- **Single-origin** for unique flavor profiles

## Grind Size Matters

Your grind size dramatically affects extraction:
- Too fine = Bitter, over-extracted
- Too coarse = Sour, under-extracted
- Just right = Balanced, sweet, and complex

## The Golden Ratio

For a standard double shot:
- **Dose**: 18-20g of ground coffee
- **Yield**: 36-40g of espresso
- **Time**: 25-30 seconds

## Extraction Tips

1. Distribute grounds evenly in the portafilter
2. Tamp with consistent pressure (around 30 lbs)
3. Pre-infuse if your machine allows
4. Watch for a steady stream - not too fast, not too slow

Practice makes perfect. Don't be discouraged if your first attempts aren't ideal!

# Latte Art for Beginners

Latte art transforms a simple coffee into a visual masterpiece. Here's how to get started.

## Equipment You'll Need

- Espresso machine with steam wand
- Milk pitcher (12-20 oz)
- Fresh whole milk
- Properly extracted espresso

## Milk Steaming Technique

Perfect microfoam is crucial:
1. Start with cold milk
2. Position wand just below surface
3. Create a whirlpool motion
4. Stop when milk reaches 140-150°F
5. Tap pitcher to remove large bubbles

## Your First Heart

1. Pour milk from high (3-4 inches) to mix
2. Lower pitcher as cup fills
3. Move forward into the center
4. Quickly pull back through the center

## Progressing to Rosettas

The rosetta requires consistent side-to-side motion while moving backward. Practice your basic pour first!

# How to Store Coffee Beans for Maximum Freshness

Coffee is at its peak within 2-4 weeks of roasting. Proper storage extends this window.

## The Four Enemies

Protect your beans from:
1. **Air** - Causes oxidation
2. **Moisture** - Degrades flavors
3. **Heat** - Accelerates staleing
4. **Light** - Breaks down compounds

## Best Practices

✅ Store in airtight container
✅ Keep in cool, dark place
✅ Buy whole beans
✅ Grind just before brewing
✅ Only buy what you'll use in 2-3 weeks

## Common Mistakes

❌ Freezing beans (causes moisture)
❌ Storing above coffee maker
❌ Keeping beans in original bag
❌ Buying pre-ground coffee

## Our Recommendation

Use opaque, airtight containers with one-way valves. We sell premium storage containers at our café!
